Hey there!!

you have most likely heard of the idea of people studying with music before

But what kind of music should you listen to? Should you even listen to music while studying??

Well, to answer the second question, its entirely up to you. If you think that music distracts your study process, then don't. But if your're on the contrary, then by all means, go ahead!!

To answer the first question, its also based on your personal preferance. Personally, I recommend the following:

(search for the playlists created by others on Spotify)

1. Lofi music

2. Acoustic songs/covers

3. Classical music

4. Soft pop music

5. Sounds of nature

6. Ed Sheeran songs

(feel free to send me a pull and add on to this list)
